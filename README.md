### ***This project is part for SwiftBeanCount, please check out the main documentation [here](https://github.com/Nef10/SwiftBeanCount).***

## What

This is a small library to convert downloaded data from Tangerine (via [TangerineDownloader](https://github.com/Nef10/TangerineDownloader)) to the Beancount format (via [SwiftBeanCountModel](https://github.com/Nef10/SwiftBeanCountModel)).

## Beancount meta data

The library relies on meta data in your Beancount file to find your accounts. For Credit Cards, please add `importer-type: "tangerine-card"` and `last-four: "XXXX"` with the last four digits of your number to your Credit Card Liability account. For other account types (like Checking, Savings, and LOC), please add `importer-type: "tangerine-account"` and `number: "XXXX"` with the account number as meta data to the account in your Beancount file.

Optionally, you can add `tangerine-interest` with the number of an account (or multiple, space separated) to the metadata of an income account where you want to book the interest. You can also add `tangerine-rewards` with the number of the (savings) account the Credit Card cashback rewards are being deposit to, to the metadata of the income account where you want to book the rewards / cashback income.
## How

1) Load your ledger, e.g. via  [SwiftBeanCountParser](https://github.com/Nef10/SwiftBeanCountParser)
2) Create an instance of `SwiftBeanCountTangerineMapper` using the ledger
3) Dowload the accounts and activities you want to convert via the [TangerineDownloader](https://github.com/Nef10/TangerineDownloader)
4) Use `createBalances` and `createTransactions` on the mapper to convert the downloaded data

Please also check out the complete documentation [here](https://nef10.github.io/SwiftBeanCountTangerineMapper/).

## Usage

The library supports the Swift Package Manger, so simply add a dependency in your `Package.swift`:

```
.package(url: "https://github.com/Nef10/SwiftBeanCountTangerineMapper.git", .exact(from: "X.Y.Z")),
```

*Note: as per semantic versioning all versions changes < 1.0.0 can be breaking, so please use `.exact` for now*
